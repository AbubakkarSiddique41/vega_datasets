# vega_datasets
A Python package for offline access to [vega datasets](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets)

This package has several goals:

- Provide straightforward access to the datasets in [vega-datasets](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets)
- return the results in the form of a Pandas dataframe
- wherever dataset licenses make it possible, bundle the dataset with the package so that no web connection is required
